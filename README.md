# devopsproject1

Short Description:
For this project first I specified the providers who will provided all the services to the resources in the providers.tf 
file, then I created all the resources, including azure accounts, aws accounts, buckets etc. in the resource.tf file. 
In some of the resources I used variables to fill in some of their attributes, and the variables are implemented in the 
variables.tf file. Finally I made one output.tf file which is responsible for managing the outputs.
